# PROJECT 4 -- Routing, Switching, and Documentation



## Project Description
This is going to a website that allows the user to have a basic template of Routing and switching for the organization.  As well as Protocols depending on each situation and who to call

## RSPD
I decided to make a FRouting, Switching, and Protocols Documentation as this a solution that my current job does not have anything centralized.  So this would be an excellent way to show my creativity as well as my problem-solving skills.
